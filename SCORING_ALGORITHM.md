# Opportunity Cost Framework - Admin Evaluation Guide

## Goal
Answer: **"What should we work on first?"** by balancing impact vs. feasibility.

---

## Impact & Value (What's the upside?)

### 1. Scale - "How many people does this help?"
- **Large (30 pts)**: 1,000+ patients or 100+ staff per year
- **Medium (20 pts)**: 100-1,000 patients or 10-100 staff per year
- **Small (10 pts)**: Under 100 people per year

### 2. Benefit Type - "What does this improve?"
- **Patient Safety (30 pts)**: Reduces harm, prevents errors
- **Patient Outcomes (25 pts)**: Better clinical results, faster recovery
- **Staff Efficiency (20 pts)**: Saves time, reduces burden
- **Cost Reduction (20 pts)**: Clear cost savings
- **Experience (15 pts)**: Better patient or staff experience

### 3. Financial Return - "Does this save money or generate revenue?"
- **High (25 pts)**: Clear cost savings or revenue opportunity
- **Some (15 pts)**: Indirect savings (time, efficiency gains)
- **Minimal (5 pts)**: Primarily quality/experience benefit

**Impact Score = Scale + Benefit + Financial = 0-85 points**

---

## Feasibility (Can we actually do this?)

### 1. Complexity - "How hard is this to build?"
- **Simple (10 pts)**: Use existing tools, basic automation
- **Moderate (20 pts)**: Some custom work, standard integrations
- **Complex (35 pts)**: Custom AI/ML, major development effort

### 2. Timeline - "How long until it's working?"
- **Quick (5 pts)**: 3-6 months to deployment
- **Standard (15 pts)**: 6-12 months to deployment
- **Long (30 pts)**: 12+ months to deployment

### 3. Dependencies - "What do we need first?"
- **Ready (5 pts)**: No blockers, can start now
- **Minor (15 pts)**: Needs approval or small prep work
- **Major (30 pts)**: Requires infrastructure, budget, or other projects first

**Feasibility Score = Complexity + Timeline + Dependencies = 0-95 points**

## Priority Matrix

| Impact | Feasibility | Priority | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|----------|---------|
| High (>60) | Low (<50) | **Quick Win** | High value, easy to do → Start now |
| High (>60) | High (≥50) | **Strategic Bet** | High value, hard to do → Worth the investment |
| Low (≤60) | Low (<50) | **Nice to Have** | Low value, easy → Do when capacity allows |
| Low (≤60) | High (≥50) | **Reconsider** | Low value, hard → Probably not worth it |

**Priority Score = (Impact × 2) - Feasibility**
- Range: -95 to 170
- Higher scores = better opportunities
- Weights impact 2x more than feasibility

## Example: Fall Risk Prediction System

**Impact Assessment:**
- Scale: Large (1000s of patients) = 30
- Benefit: Patient Safety = 30
- Financial: Some (reduces falls/costs) = 15
- **Impact Total = 75**

**Feasibility Assessment:**
- Complexity: Moderate (standard ML) = 20
- Timeline: Standard (6-12 months) = 15
- Dependencies: Minor (needs data team) = 15
- **Feasibility Total = 50**

**Result:**
- Priority Score = (75 × 2) - 50 = **100**
- Classification: **Strategic Bet** (high impact, moderate feasibility)
- Recommendation: Worth investing in, plan carefully

## Admin Notes & Tags

Beyond the core scoring, admins can add:
- **Tags**: Strategic Priority, Regulatory, High Change Impact, etc.
- **Notes**: Budget status, team capacity, special considerations
- **Dependencies**: Specific blockers or prerequisites

This provides context without overcomplicating the evaluation.
