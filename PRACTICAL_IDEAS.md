# 6 Practical, Executable AI Initiatives for AdventHealth

Based on research of proven healthcare AI implementations, these are tangible, achievable projects that AdventHealth could implement.

---

## 1. Automated Patient Appointment Reminders & Scheduling Optimization

**Department:** Patient Access / Scheduling  
**Area:** Clinical Operations  
**Urgency:** Medium  
**Risk Level:** Low

**Problem Statement:**
No-show rates average 15-20% across our facilities, costing thousands in lost revenue and disrupting care continuity. Manual reminder calls are time-consuming and inconsistent. Patients also struggle to find available appointments that fit their schedules.

**AI Approach:**
Implement an AI-powered appointment reminder system that:
- Sends personalized SMS/email reminders at optimal times based on patient behavior patterns
- Predicts no-show likelihood and triggers proactive outreach for high-risk appointments
- Suggests optimal rescheduling times when patients need to cancel
- Analyzes scheduling patterns to recommend better appointment slot allocation

**Primary Users:**
- Scheduling coordinators
- Front desk staff
- Patients

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce no-show rates by 30-40%
- Save 10+ hours/week in manual reminder calls per facility
- Improve appointment utilization and revenue

**Implementation Complexity:** Low (existing vendor solutions available)

## 2. AI-Assisted Clinical Documentation for Discharge Summaries

**Department:** Hospital Medicine  
**Area:** Clinical Care  
**Urgency:** High  
**Risk Level:** Medium

**Problem Statement:**
Hospitalists spend 15-20 minutes per discharge summary, often staying late to complete documentation. This leads to burnout and delays in patient discharge. Summaries are sometimes incomplete or lack important details for follow-up providers.

**AI Approach:**
Deploy AI scribe technology that:
- Listens to physician-patient conversations during discharge planning
- Auto-generates draft discharge summaries with key elements (diagnosis, treatment, medications, follow-up)
- Pulls relevant data from EHR automatically
- Allows physician to review, edit, and approve in 2-3 minutes

**Primary Users:**
- Hospitalists
- Physician assistants
- Nurse practitioners

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce documentation time from 15 minutes to 3 minutes per discharge
- Save 200+ physician hours per month system-wide
- Improve discharge summary completeness and quality
- Reduce physician burnout

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium (requires EHR integration and physician training)

## 3. Predictive Staffing Model for Emergency Departments

**Department:** Emergency Medicine  
**Area:** Clinical Operations  
**Urgency:** High  
**Risk Level:** Low

**Problem Statement:**
ED patient volumes fluctuate unpredictably, leading to either overstaffing (wasted resources) or understaffing (long wait times, poor patient experience). Current staffing models rely on historical averages and don't account for real-time factors like weather, local events, or flu season.

**AI Approach:**
Build a predictive analytics model that:
- Forecasts ED patient volume 24-72 hours in advance
- Considers weather, day of week, local events, seasonal trends, and historical patterns
- Recommends optimal staffing levels by hour
- Sends alerts when predicted volume exceeds current staffing capacity

**Primary Users:**
- ED nurse managers
- Staffing coordinators
- Hospital operations leaders

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce wait times by 20-30%
- Optimize staffing costs by 10-15%
- Improve patient satisfaction scores
- Reduce staff overtime and burnout

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium (requires data integration and model training)

## 4. Automated Prior Authorization Assistant

**Department:** Revenue Cycle / Utilization Management  
**Area:** Back-Office  
**Urgency:** High  
**Risk Level:** Low

**Problem Statement:**
Prior authorization requests take 20-30 minutes each to complete manually. Staff spend hours on hold with insurance companies, gathering documentation, and filling out redundant forms. Delays in authorization lead to delayed care and patient frustration.

**AI Approach:**
Implement an AI assistant that:
- Auto-fills prior authorization forms using data from EHR
- Predicts which procedures/medications will require prior auth
- Tracks authorization status and sends automated follow-ups
- Identifies patterns in denials and suggests alternative approaches

**Primary Users:**
- Prior authorization specialists
- Case managers
- Physicians (who currently have to provide additional documentation)

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce time per prior auth from 30 minutes to 5 minutes
- Process 3-4x more authorizations per staff member
- Reduce authorization turnaround time from 3-5 days to 24-48 hours
- Improve care access and patient satisfaction

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium (requires payer integration and workflow redesign)

## 5. Fall Risk Prediction & Alert System for Inpatient Units

**Department:** Nursing / Patient Safety  
**Area:** Clinical Care  
**Urgency:** High  
**Risk Level:** Medium

**Problem Statement:**
Patient falls are a leading cause of hospital-acquired injuries, resulting in longer stays, increased costs, and poor outcomes. Current fall risk assessments are manual, subjective, and often outdated. High-risk patients aren't always identified in time.

**AI Approach:**
Deploy a real-time fall risk prediction system that:
- Continuously analyzes patient data (vitals, medications, mobility, cognition, age)
- Predicts fall risk score in real-time and updates as conditions change
- Alerts nurses when a patient's risk level increases
- Suggests specific interventions (bed alarm, hourly rounding, mobility assistance)

**Primary Users:**
- Bedside nurses
- Charge nurses
- Patient safety coordinators

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce inpatient falls by 25-35%
- Prevent serious injuries and associated costs
- Improve patient safety metrics and HCAHPS scores
- Reduce nurse liability and stress

**Implementation Complexity:** Medium (requires EHR integration and nurse workflow training)

## 6. Pharmacy Inventory Optimization & Expiration Tracking

**Department:** Pharmacy  
**Area:** Clinical Support  
**Urgency:** Medium  
**Risk Level:** Low

**Problem Statement:**
Medication waste due to expiration costs tens of thousands annually. Manual inventory tracking is time-consuming and error-prone. Pharmacies often run out of critical medications while overstocking others. Staff spend hours counting and reordering.

**AI Approach:**
Implement an AI-powered inventory management system that:
- Predicts medication usage patterns based on historical data and patient census
- Automatically generates reorder recommendations
- Tracks expiration dates and alerts staff 30/60/90 days in advance
- Suggests redistribution of near-expiry medications to high-use units
- Optimizes par levels to minimize waste while preventing stockouts

**Primary Users:**
- Pharmacists
- Pharmacy technicians
- Supply chain coordinators

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce medication waste by 40-50%
- Save $50K-$100K annually per facility
- Reduce stockouts of critical medications by 80%
- Free up 10+ pharmacy staff hours per week

**Implementation Complexity:** Low (existing vendor solutions available)
